# Assets

Nuxt uses two directories to handle assets like stylesheets, fonts or images:

- The [`assets/` directory](/guide/directory-structure/assets) contains every asset that you want the build tool (Vite or Webpack) to process.
- The [`public/` directory](/guide/directory-structure/public) content is served at the server root as-is.

## `assets/` directory

Nuxt uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html) or [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/) to build and bundle your application. The main function of these build tools is to process JavaScript files, but they can be extended through [plugins](https://vitejs.dev/plugins/) (for Vite) or [loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/) (for Webpack) to process other kind of assets, like stylesheets, fonts or SVG. This step transforms the original file mainly for performance or caching purposes (such as stylesheets minification or browser cache invalidation).

In your application's code, you can reference a file located in the `assets/` directory by using the `~/assets/` path.

Nuxt won't serve files in the `assets/` directory at a static URL like `/assets/my-file.png`. If you need a static URL, use the [`public/` directory](#public-directory).
::

### Example

For example, referencing an image file that will be processed if a build tool is configured to handle this file extension:

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <img src="assets/img/nuxt.png" alt="Discover Nuxt 3" />
</template>
```

## `public/` directory

The `public/` directory is used as a public server for static assets that build tools don't need to process. This includes files whose names cannot be changed (for example `robots.txt`), or the ones you want to be publicly available at a defined URL of your application.

You can get a file in the `public/` directory from your application's code or from a browser by the root URL `/`.

::alert{type=info}
Nuxt can be configured to use a different name for this directory in the [`nuxt.config` file](/api/configuration/nuxt.config#public).
::

::alert{type=warning}
In Nuxt 2, this directory is called `static/`.

### Example

For example, referencing an image file in the `public/img/` directory, available at the static URL `/img/nuxt.png`:

```vue [app.vue]
<template>
  <img src="/img/nuxt.png" alt="Discover Nuxt 3" />
</template>
```
